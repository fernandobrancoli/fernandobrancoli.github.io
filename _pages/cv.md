**Bio**

I am an Associate Professor in the fields of International Relations, Defense and Security, and Political Risk Analysis for undergraduate and graduate courses at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/)), including the [Institute of International Relations and Defense (IRID-UFRJ)](https://irid.ufrj.br/) and the [COPPEAD Graduate School of Business](https://www.coppead.ufrj.br/en/). Additionally, I am a recurring professor in the MBA in International Relations at the [Getulio Vargas Foundation](https://fgv.br/mba/ri), teaching at their campuses in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Brasília. 

I am also a Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Studies (SPSS)](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2022/fernando-brancoli-fellow-summer-program-social-science) in Princeton, US (2021-2023) and an Associated Researcher at the [Orfalea Center for Global Studies](https://secure.lsit.ucsb.edu/gisp/d7_orfalea-2/people/fernando-brancoli) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, US. 

I hold a PhD from the Graduate Program in International Relations at San Tiago Dantas (UNESP, Unicamp, and PUC-SP), Brazil, with a research period at the Center for Global Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am also part of a network of speakers at the [Asian Forum on Global Governance in India](https://www.orfonline.org/contributors/fernando-brancoli/) and the [Bucerius Summer School](https://www.bucerius-summer-school.de/f/34c66b33f8.pdf) in Germany.

My professional experience entails working as an international journalist and humanitarian specialist in conflict zones spanning across Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Presently, my research primarily concentrates on South-South relations, with a significant emphasis on narratives of security and development. Through conducting extensive fieldwork across three continents, my research strives to illuminate the intricate interactions and interdependencies between local and transnational agents. My recent books include The Tropical Silk Road: The Future of China in South America (with Paul Amar and Lisa Rofel (Stanford University Press, 2022), Private Security Companies in the Global South (UFRJ, 2021), and Arab Spring: Squares, Streets, and Revolts (Desatino, 2016). I have published more than a dozen articles in different peer-reviewed journals, such as Contexto Internacional—Journal of Global Connections; Brasiliana; and Security in Context, among others.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I also play an active role in training Brazilian public officials in the field of Political Risk Analysis and Geopolitics. I have conducted training programs for [diplomats at the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.canalfambras.org.br/problemas-persistentes-nas-revoltas-arabes-sao-tratados-por-fernando-brancoli/), [security agents and police officers](https://www.facebook.com/Coppead/photos/a.311949278846692/2743084612399801/?type=3), and [public managers](https://www.coppead.ufrj.br/novos-lideres-cariocas-tomam-posse-no-aniversario-do-rio/). These programs are developed in partnership with the Coppead Institute at UFRJ and various government agencies. 

As a public intellectual, I am actively engaged in publishing articles and participating in political debates. My articles have appeared in prestigious international media outlets such as the Al Jazeera, CNN, LA Times, and the Wilson Center, as well as major Brazilian newspapers including Globo and Folha de São Paulo. I am frequently invited to participate in political debates on Brazil's largest television networks, such as Rede Globo and CNN Brasil.
