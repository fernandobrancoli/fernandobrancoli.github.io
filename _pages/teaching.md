I am a professor in the fields of International Relations, Defense and Security, and Political Risk Analysis for undergraduate and graduate courses. I teach courses primarily at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's [Institute of International Relations and Defense (IRID-UFRJ)](https://irid.ufrj.br/) and the [COPPEAD Graduate School of Business](https://www.coppead.ufrj.br/en/). Additionally, I am a recurring professor in the MBA in International Relations at the [Getulio Vargas Foundation](https://portal.fgv.br/en/), teaching at their campuses in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Brasília.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I also play an active role in training Brazilian public officials in the field of Political Risk Analysis and Geopolitics. I have conducted training programs for [diplomats at the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.canalfambras.org.br/problemas-persistentes-nas-revoltas-arabes-sao-tratados-por-fernando-brancoli/), [security agents and police officers](https://www.facebook.com/Coppead/photos/a.311949278846692/2743084612399801/?type=3), and [public managers](https://www.coppead.ufrj.br/novos-lideres-cariocas-tomam-posse-no-aniversario-do-rio/). These programs are developed in partnership with the Coppead Institute at UFRJ and various government agencies. 

I invite you to visit the websites of the mentioned institutions to find the syllabi and course programs of the courses I offer.
