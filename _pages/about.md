Hi! Welcome to my (quite amateur) website. I created this space to better connect with colleagues from outside Brazil since our university pages can be a bit confusing.

I am an Associate Professor of International Security and Geopolitics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro’s Institute of International Relations and Defense (IRID-UFRJ) in Brazil and a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies (SPSS) in Princeton, US (2021-2023). Additionally, I am an Associated Researcher at the Orfalea Center for Global Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, US. My research primarily focuses on South-South relations, with a significant emphasis on narratives of security and development. Through extensive fieldwork across three continents, my research aims to shed light on the complex interactions and interdependencies between local and transnational agents.

My professional experience includes working as an international journalist and humanitarian specialist in conflict zones across Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Currently,  My recent books include The Tropical Silk Road: The Future of China in South America (with Paul Amar and Lisa Rofel, Stanford University Press, 2022), Private Security Companies in the Global South (UFRJ, 2021), and Arab Spring: Squares, Streets, and Revolts (Desatino, 2016). I have published more than a dozen articles in various peer-reviewed journals, such as Contexto Internacional—Journal of Global Connections; Brasiliana; and Security in Context, among others.

As one of Brazil's most active public intellectuals, my articles have appeared in the New York Times, Al Jazeera, CNN, Globo, the LA Times, and Folha de São Paulo. I am frequently invited to participate in political debates on Brazil's largest television networks, including Rede Globo and CNN Brasil. In addition, I have been invited as a specialist to boards at the Brazilian Senate and the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
