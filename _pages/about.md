Hello and welcome to my website! I am delighted to provide this platform as a means to strengthen connections with colleagues outside of Brazil. As navigating our local university pages can prove challenging, I hope that this site offers a more efficient and straightforward way to connect with me and stay up-to-date with my research.

I am an Associate Professor of International Security and Geopolitics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro’s Institute of International Relations and Defense (IRID-UFRJ) in Brazil. My research primarily focuses on transnational political violence, international security and climate politics with a focus on Latin America and the Global South. Through extensive fieldwork across four continents, my research aims to shed light on the complex interactions and interdependencies between local and transnational agents.

My recent books include [Bolsonarismo - The Global Origins and Future of Brazil’s Far Right](https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/bolsonarismo/9781978838550/) (Rutgers University Press, 2023), [The Tropical Silk Road: The Future of China in South America](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=34134) (with Paul Amar and Lisa Rofel, Stanford University Press, 2022), Private Security Companies in the Global South (UFRJ, 2021), and Arab Spring: Squares, Streets, and Revolts (Desatino, 2016). I have published more than a dozen articles in various peer-reviewed journals, such as Contexto Internacional—Journal of Global Connections; Brasiliana; and Security in Context, among others.

As one of Brazil's most active public intellectuals, my articles have appeared in the Al Jazeera, CNN, Le Monde Diplomatique, Los Angeles Times, Globo, and Folha de São Paulo. I am frequently invited to participate in political debates on Brazil's largest television networks, including Rede Globo and CNN Brasil. In addition, I have been invited as a specialist to boards at the Brazilian Senate and the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
