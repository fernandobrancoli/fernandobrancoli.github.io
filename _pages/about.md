I am an Associate Professor in the fields of International Relations, Defense and Security, and Political Risk Analysis for undergraduate and graduate courses at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ([UFRJ](https://ufrj.br/)), including the [Institute of International Relations and Defense (IRID-UFRJ)](https://irid.ufrj.br/) and the [COPPEAD Graduate School of Business](https://www.coppead.ufrj.br/en/). Additionally, I am a recurring professor in the MBA in International Relations at the [Getulio Vargas Foundation](https://fgv.br/mba/ri), teaching at their campuses in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Brasília. 

My research primarily focuses on transnational political violence, international security and climate politics with a focus on Latin America and the Global South. Through extensive fieldwork across four continents, my research aims to shed light on the complex interactions and interdependencies between local and transnational agents. 

I am  a Fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Studies (SPSS)](https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2022/fernando-brancoli-fellow-summer-program-social-science) in Princeton, US (2021-2023) and a Program Fellow  at the [Governance and Local Development Instituteat the University of Gothenburg](https://gld.gu.se/en/about-gld/our-mission/https://gld.gu.se/en/about-gld/network-of-scholars/programme-fellows-2024/fernando-brancoli/). I also serve at the Board of Advisors of the [Security in Context Project](https://www.securityincontext.org/team/fernando-brancoli) and, since 2015, I am an Associated Researcher at the [Orfalea Center for Global Studies](https://secure.lsit.ucsb.edu/gisp/d7_orfalea-2/people/fernando-brancoli) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, US. 

My recent books include [Bolsonarismo - The Global Origins and Future of Brazil’s Far Right](https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/bolsonarismo/9781978838550/) (Rutgers University Press, 2023) and [The Tropical Silk Road: The Future of China in South America](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=34134) (with Paul Amar and Lisa Rofel, Stanford University Press, 2022). I have published more than a dozen articles in various peer-reviewed journals, such as Contexto Internacional—Journal of Global Connections; Brasiliana; and Security in Context, among others.

As one of Brazil's most active public intellectuals, my articles have appeared in the Al Jazeera, CNN, Le Monde Diplomatique, Los Angeles Times, Globo, and Folha de São Paulo. I am frequently invited to participate in political debates on Brazil's largest television networks, including Rede Globo and CNN Brasil. In addition, I have been invited as a specialist to boards at the Brazilian Senate and the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
